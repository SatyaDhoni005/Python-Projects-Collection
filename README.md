# Python-Projects-Collection

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python projects I developed during my learning journey.  
Each project focuses on different programming concepts, ranging from **basic Python logic building** to **GUI applications** and **database integration**.

## List of Projects
1. **Password Generator**  
   - Generates strong random passwords based on user-defined length.
   - Uses letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - **Tech Used:** Python, `random`, `math`

2. **Number Guessing Game**  
   - Player guesses a number between 1 and 100 within limited attempts.
   - Two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard.
   - **Tech Used:** Python, `random`

3. **True or False Quiz**  
   - A simple quiz game that asks True/False questions.
   - Keeps track of score.
   - **Tech Used:** Python, OOP concepts

4. **Higher or Lower Game**  
   - Player guesses which option has a higher number (like followers, score, etc.).
   - Uses multiple data comparisons.
   - **Tech Used:** Python, OOP concepts

5. **Coffee Machine Logic**  
   - Simulates a coffee vending machine.
   - Manages resources (water, milk, coffee) and processes coins.
   - **Tech Used:** Python

6. **To-Do List Application (Tkinter + SQLite)**  
   - GUI-based task management application.
   - Tasks stored in an SQLite database for persistence.
   - **Tech Used:** Python, Tkinter, SQLite

7. **Rock Paper Scissors Game (Tkinter)**  
   - GUI-based game with images for user and computer choices.
   - Keeps track of scores and declares winners.
   - **Tech Used:** Python, Tkinter, Pillow (`PIL`)

## How to Run Any Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/SatyaDhoni005/Python-Projects-Collection.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ---bash
   cd folder-name
3. Run the Python script:
   ---bash
   python filename.py

## Technologies Used Across Projects
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI development)
- SQLite (Database)
- Pillow (PIL) for image handling
- Built-in Python modules like random, math
- OOP principles
